# Personal Portfolio – layout plan

## Goal
Minimal, professional single-page portfolio (scroll). One accent color, lots of whitespace.

## Sections (top to bottom)
1. Navbar (sticky): About / Projects / Skills / Contact
2. Hero: Name + 1-liner + buttons (GitHub, LinkedIn)
3. About: 3–5 lines (what I'm studying + what I'm building)
4. Projects: 3–6 cards (image, title, 1-line description, Live + Repo)
5. Skills: badges (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git, GitHub, etc.)
6. Contact: Email + links (GitHub, LinkedIn)
7. Footer: "Part of Altcademy’s Fullstack Program" + link to altcademy

## Visual style
- Background: very light gray
- Text: near black + muted gray
- Accent: blue/indigo (links/buttons)
- Cards: subtle border/shadow, rounded corners
